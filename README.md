# PyBroeModules

(Personal) Python Modules used regualarly in multiple projects/contexts.

And, more importantly, my GIT Sandbox.

Next thing to do ... getting into automatic documentation, which is currently a nice idea based on my javadoc
experiences but complete chaos in the python practice!

See you soon with more,
